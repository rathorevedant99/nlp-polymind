Napoleonic times I think.\r\nAnna: Ah... It's old. I don't like such books. I prefer something about love and passion.\r\nMark: There's a lot of that in this book ;) \r\nAnna: Rly?\r\nMat: Oh sure!

It's a matter of time.\r\nLuisa: That's what we thought last spring when we put it on the market.\r\nLeu: It took me 2 years to sell my flat back in Poland.\r\nLuisa: Oh well... Wait and see. The last prospective buyers we had, 5 weeks back, were so enthusiastic we'd thought we're done. They said ours was shortlisted, their favourite in Ballito, but they still wanted to check another estate. And that was it. She didn't even bother to phone, just sent me a minimal message. Bill got so frustrated that he drank himself stiff that night.\r\nLeu: He does it from time to time, doesn't he?\r\nLuisa: From time to time? Regularly!!! Can't you remember?!\r\nLeu: Not quite. Never saw him really tight.\r\nLuisa: Cause you used to leave before his evening was over. I'm seriously worried about his health, to tell you the truth. It's just every day that he tipples.\r\nLeu: As if slowly killing himself with liquor.\r\nLuisa: He doesn't care. He says he's got his life behind him.\r\nLeu: But it is terrible. How can you cope with it?\r\nLuisa: I stopped to care too. It is his life. If he wants to put a quicker end to it, it's up to him. Look I cannot do anything about it. What hide bottles? Just don't want to have an invalid in my house one day.\r\nLeu: Therapy?\r\nLuisa: Gimme a break! Can you imagine Bill attending an AA therapy like a good boy! I can't.\r\nLeu: Nor can I.\r\nLuisa: We even stopped talking about his drinking problem long ago. When he started, just after and because of his early retirement, I thought I'd better refrain from commenting because he's so depressed. But then it was worse and worse... Now it's too late.\r\nLeu: Poor Luisa, poor Bill. It is so sad. But you are tough Luisa. You are so incredibly tough and strong and even-tempered, I'd say.\r\nLuisa: Yes, I am. That keeps me sane. I don't worry if I can't change it. To a degree...\r\nLeu: Right you are! \"The beach scape changes every month as tides bring in tons of sand and cover the rocks making the beach appear totally different.\" Do you remember?\r\nLuisa: \"Then the rocks are laid bare as the tide pulls away the sand.

But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally.

Just give me your dates and I'll keep it booked for you.\r\nBeryl: Would you prefer me to do it via airbnb website or just like this directly with you?\r\nAnton: I think it'll be more advantageous for both of us to do it directly.

As I say we've been receiving bookings daily now.\r\nBeryl: Well, no big deal.

She walked a 21 km marathon on Sunday.\r\nJill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?\r\nDoris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.\r\nJill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say. How does she take it emotionally?\r\nDoris: She is quite strong.\r\nJill: Good! You too I hope?\r\nDoris: Yes, absolutely.\r\nJill: Keep it up! Where is she?\r\nDoris: Pietermaritzburg\r\nJill: How long do you have to drive there?\r\nDoris: 1.5 hours off peak traffic.\r\nJill: Not so bad. Will you be driving to see her soon?\r\nDoris: Dunno yet. Her condition is stable. She's got her husband and 3 children around her. But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!\r\nJill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you.\r\nDoris: Thx Jill.

But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!\r\nJill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you.\r\nDoris: Thx Jill.

Any others?\r\nRamsay: Well, all the old Rankin Bass stop motion ones like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and The Year Without a Santa Claus.\r\nJulie: Those are great for the kids, right?\r\nRamsay: I kind of like them myself!

She has had 2 stents fitted.\r\nJill: Oh Doris! So sorry! But good news she is on the mend. Miracles of medicine.\r\nDoris: This has given the family a great shock as she was so well. She walked a 21 km marathon on Sunday.\r\nJill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?\r\nDoris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.\r\nJill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say.

But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally.

She walked a 21 km marathon on Sunday.\r\nJill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?\r\nDoris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.\r\nJill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say.

Will you be driving to see her soon?\r\nDoris: Dunno yet. Her condition is stable. She's got her husband and 3 children around her. But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally. She's strong but her body may need a rest. We'll see!\r\nJill: I'll keep fingers crossed for you! Both of you.\r\nDoris: Thx Jill.

I'm going shopping in a bit, so I'll call you and let you know.\r\nLisha: Alright! In the meantime, can I borrow your computer :)\r\nRasha: Yeah, I don't really need it. You want me to bring it to school? The only thing is that it's quite slow.\r\nLisha: That'd be great. I don't care. I'm just gonna be using Word. I have to write that report on aboriginals.\r\nRasha: I finished that last week. You wanna see mine?

She has had 2 stents fitted.\r\nJill: Oh Doris! So sorry! But good news she is on the mend. Miracles of medicine.\r\nDoris: This has given the family a great shock as she was so well. She walked a 21 km marathon on Sunday.\r\nJill: Did she strain her heart during the walk?\r\nDoris: We don't know, but there is also sign of an injury a long while ago. It worries me that there was no warning.\r\nJill: It is worrying that we can't see what's getting weaker within us. No warnings as you say.

But I may go and stay with her when she's back home.\r\nJill: To help with the household?\r\nDoris: Exactly. But it may be that they'll first send her for recuperation somewhere.\r\nJill: They usually do after a serious operation, don't they?\r\nDoris: That would be very good for her indeed. Also mentally.

So happy trails to you!\r\nSoph: Thanks. Love. Sophie",
