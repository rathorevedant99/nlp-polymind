Lucy: Hi. Are the rollerblades still available?
Hannah: Yes, they are. Are you interested?
Lucy: How much is the delivery?
Hannah: It depends on the company and delivery time. Here's the price list. 
Lucy: Thank you. That's most helpful.
Hannah: :-)
Lucy: One more thing. Are the scratches which are shown in the photo the only defects? Is there anything else I should know about the rollerblades? They are supposed to be a present for my niece. I wouldn't like to have a nasty surprise when I get them.
Hannah: Only the scratches. The rest is fine. I may send you some more photos if you wish. Basically, these are good rollerblades. I'm selling them because I got an injury. Otherwise I'd still be using them.
Lucy: I see. Are they good for beginners?
Hannah: Yes.
Lucy: Is it the final price?
Hannah: I'm afraid, it is. This is a really good buy. You won't regret it.
Lucy: It's not about me. It's about my niece.
Hannah: She'll love them.
Lucy: OK. Let me think about it a little more. I'll come back to you in the evening.
Hannah: No problem. 
Lucy: If I decide on the purchase today, maybe you will re-think the price? Small discount, perhaps?
Hannah: No, I'm really sorry. I bought them for much much more and they are still in good condition. I can't lower the price any more.

Wilson: <file_photo>
Wilson: There was some turbulence on the flight, but nothing serious ;)
Leah: Sweet! Looks like they're really pampering you.
Wilson: Yeah, seems that way :)
Wilson: Although tomorrow we'll be spending the entire day on the pitch so I don't know if I'll get to enjoy it as much as I would like.
Leah: Well make the most of it love :)
Wilson: I was actually thinking that maybe you'ld like to come back here with me :) I could show you the sights, tell you what knowledge I've gleamed from the locals ;)
Leah: That sounds really nice actually. I've always wanted to go to Barcelona with a hot guy on my arm ;)
Wilson: Don't worry, I'll be your arm candy any time :P
Leah: Oh please - you'll be much more than that. I'm counting on you to be my personal masseuse and to carry my luggage.
Wilson: My girlfriend - the diva.
